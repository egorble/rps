# Animation Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The previous implementation was showing "boom" (tie) animation for all rounds, regardless of the actual game result. The animation sequence needed to be improved to:

1. Properly determine the winner from the current player's perspective
2. Show hand shaking animation first
3. Display player choices
4. Show win/lose/tie result

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Winner Determination Logic

Updated the Room component to correctly determine win/lose from the current player's perspective:

```javascript
// Determine the result text based on the round result
// Check if current player is player1 or player2 to determine win/lose from their perspective
let text = "tie";
if (round.result === "Player1Wins" || round.result === "WIN") {
  // If there's a winner, check if it's the current player
  if (round.winner) {
    text = (player_1 && player_1 === round.winner) ? "win" : "lose";
  } else if (player_1 && player_1 === round.player1) {
    // Fallback: if no winner field, assume player1 won
    text = "win";
  } else {
    text = "lose";
  }
} else if (round.result === "Player2Wins") {
  text = (player_1 && player_1 === round.player2) ? "win" : "lose";
} else if (round.result === "LOSE") {
  // If result is LOSE, check if current player is the loser or if they're the other player who won
  if (round.winner) {
    text = (player_1 && player_1 === round.winner) ? "win" : "lose";
  } else {
    // Fallback for LOSE without winner field
    text = "lose";
  }
} else if (round.result === "Tie" || round.result === "DRAW") {
  text = "tie";
}
```

### 2. Improved Animation Sequence

Completely revamped the animation logic to follow a proper sequence:

1. **Hand Shaking Phase**: 4 cycles of hand shaking (±10 degree rotation)
2. **Choice Reveal Phase**: Show player choices (1 second)
3. **Result Display Phase**: Show win/lose/tie result (2 seconds)
4. **Reset Phase**: Prepare for next round

```javascript
const performAnimation = async (text) => {
  const timer = (ms) => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, ms));

  // First phase: Hand shaking animation (4 cycles)
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    setResult({ rotate: 10, show: false, reset: false });
    await timer(150);
    setResult({ rotate: -10, show: false, reset: false });
    await timer(150);
  }
  
  // Second phase: Show choices (reveal what each player chose)
  setResult({ rotate: 0, show: true, reset: false });
  await timer(1000); // Show choices for 1 second
  
  // Third phase: Show result (win/lose/tie)
  setResultText(text);
  await timer(2000);
  
  // Fourth phase: Reset for next round
  setResult({ rotate: 0, show: false, reset: true });
  setResultText("");
  await timer(500);

  return Promise.resolve();
};
```

### 3. Added Debugging Information

Added console logs to help debug round information:

```javascript
console.log("Animating round:", round);
console.log("Current player:", player_1);
console.log("Determined result text:", text);
```

### 4. Round History Processing

The animation now properly processes round history from the blockchain:

- Only animates rounds where both players have made choices
- Tracks animated rounds to prevent duplicates
- Processes rounds in order

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Winner Detection**: Now correctly shows win/lose based on whether the current player won or lost
2. **Better Animation Flow**: Clear sequence of hand shaking → choice reveal → result display
3. **Tie Handling**: Properly handles tie results
4. **Debugging Support**: Added logs to help troubleshoot issues
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensures each round is only animated once

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Start a game with two players
2. Make choices for each player
3. Observe the animation sequence:
   - Hands shake first
   - Choices are revealed
   - Correct win/lose/tie result is shown
4. Verify that the result is from the current player's perspective

The animation should now properly show "win" when the current player wins, "lose" when they lose, and "boom" (tie) when it's a tie.
